description = """I commissioned this from a small time artist who I was later told was severely under-charging her customers. She apparently got harrassed for this regularly, and eventually gave up doing art for money. I last recall she was going into the business of inventing home cleaning products, such as a super concentrated cleanser to save shipping space, which would later be reconstituted at home with tap water."""

        alt="A Halloween themed artwork of my cat character. It is set against a static spooky background with a black cat on the ground, a flaming orange sky, with a huge green moon and white clouds, and the year 2015 marked. The actual artwork features my cat wearing a labcoat, a stethoscope, and a headband mirror. His tongue is sticking out slightly, and he's holding up the probe end of the stethoscope. His name, Kuroshi, is written in the sky next to him."
