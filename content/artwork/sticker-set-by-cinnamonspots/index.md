Featured, from left to right, top to bottom: Pouncing on something, laughing at something, blushing, playing innocent with a halo over his head, interrupting this story with a news bulletin, presenting a nosebleed, facepalming, confused with a question mark balloon, stomach growling and thinking of food, dazed and tired and ready for a nap, plotting and scheming, cross at you for something with his arms folded, yelling NO at the viewer, shrugging, reading a book, throwing his arms in the air and yelling yay, mooning the viewer mischievously, licking his chops and drooling hungrily, responding to a Chilean cat call of cuchito cuchito, and finally, waving US and Chilean flags in representation of my long distance relationship."
