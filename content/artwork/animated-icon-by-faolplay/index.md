description = """I commissioned this icon from FaolPlay, who was doing a theme of snowfall icons with a still base image of your description. Unfortunately, the original was posted to Twitter, so it was lost when Twitter started mutating GIFs into heavily compressed MPEG-4 videos, as so many sites are doing now. Luckily, I had saved the original GIF when it was posted to me, so here it is."""
