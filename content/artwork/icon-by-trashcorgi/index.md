description = """My first commission from TrashCorgi, who I later learned was in a sort of rivalry with CyanSorcery, or at least there was animosity from CyanSorcery. How unfortunate that they could not be on more friendly terms with each other, and that I should end up commissioning them both at times. I had to rescue it from the JPEG format that was originally posted to Twitter, as the format kind of messed up the original coloring. I re-posterized it using best case approximations of the original flat colors, and let the JPEG artifacts slightly mess up the dithering, but posterization mostly rescued it."""
