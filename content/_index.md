I am Kuroshi. You may also know me as kode54, or Chris Moeller, or my real name, Christopher Snowhill. My character is a literal tuxedo cat, with a tuxedo fur pattern in black and white, with cuff forepaws, and shirt and buttons chest pattern. I came up with this idea for a character with the acquisition of two lovely tuxedo cats, who brighten up my family&rsquo;s daily life and have been with us since December of 2013.
